# odin-recipes
This project will test my HTML skills I have learned in odin.
I will be creating recipes website.

In this project I have memorized what the boilerplate code looks like and how to use automatic filler for boilerplate.

I implemented links<a href=""> in the homepage to recipe page where I used <img src="" alt=""> to show proper images of the recipe.
This page also show headings of description, ingredients and steps using <h1>.
Under those headings I used paragaraph tag, unorder lists of ingredients, and order lists of steps.
